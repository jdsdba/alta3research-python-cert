## About the Project
alta3research-python-cert models a chase from the popular table top role playing game, Call of Cthulhu.  For authors writing game sceneros, it could help show if a chase scene is balanced, and tweak the scene if not. This program uses a simplified version of the chase rules in the game. For more info on the chase rules, see
